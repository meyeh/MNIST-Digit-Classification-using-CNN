# MNIST Digit Classification
This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Dataset
- **MNIST Dataset**:A dataset containing 70,000 greyscale 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits from 0-9. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Notebook
-  `CNN_MNISTDigit.ipynb`: Notebook containing,
    - Data loading and Preprocessing (normalization, label encoding)
    - Model creation and Image Augmentation
    - Training
    - Model Evaluatiion
    - Performance Metrics
    - Image viewer for any handwritten digit
